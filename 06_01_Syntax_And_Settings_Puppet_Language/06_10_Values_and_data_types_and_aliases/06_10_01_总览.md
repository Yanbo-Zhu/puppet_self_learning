- **[Abstract data types](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/lang_data_abstract#lang_data_abstract)**  
    If you’re using data types to match or restrict values and need more flexibility than what the core data types (such as `String` or `Array`) allow, you can use one of the _abstract data types_ to construct a data type that suits your needs and matches the values you want.
- **[Arrays](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/lang_data_array#lang_data_array)**  
    Arrays are ordered lists of values. Resource attributes which accept multiple values (including the relationship metaparameters) generally expect those values in an array. Many functions also take arrays, including the iteration functions.
- **[Binary](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/lang_data_binary)**  
    A `Binary` object represents a sequence of bytes and it can be created from a String in Base64 format, a verbatim `String`, or an `Array` containing byte values. A `Binary` can also be created from a Hash containing the value to convert to a `Binary`.
- **[Booleans](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/lang_data_boolean)**  
    Booleans are one-bit values, representing true or false. The condition of an `if` statement expects an expression that resolves to a Boolean value. All of Puppet's comparison operators resolve to Boolean values, as do many functions.
- **[Data type syntax](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/lang_data_type#lang_data_type)**  
    Each value in the Puppet language has a data type, like “string.” There is also a set of values _whose data type is “data type.”_ These values represent the other data types. For example, the value `String` represents the data type of strings. The value that represents the data type of _these_ values is `Type`.
- **[Default](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/lang_data_default)**  
    Puppet’s `default` value acts like a keyword in a few specific usages. Less commonly, it can also be used as a value.
- **[Error data type](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/error-data-type)**  
    An `Error` object contains a non-empty message. It can also contain additional context about why the error occurred.
- **[Hashes](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/lang_data_hash#lang_data_hash)**  
    Hashes map keys to values, maintaining the order of the entries according to insertion order.
- **[Numbers](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/lang_data_number#lang_data_number)**  
    Numbers in the Puppet language are normal integers and floating point numbers.
- **[Regular expressions](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/lang_data_regexp#lang_data_regexp)**  
    A regular expression (sometimes shortened to “regex” or “regexp”) is a pattern that can match some set of strings, and optionally capture parts of those strings for further use.
- **[Resource and class references](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/lang_data_resource_reference)**  
    Resource references identify a specific Puppet resource by its type and title. Several attributes, such as the relationship metaparameters, require resource references.
- **[Resource types](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/lang_data_resource_type#lang_data_resource_type)**  
    Resource types are a special family of data types that behave differently from other data types. They are subtypes of the fairly abstract `Resource` data type. Resource references are a useful subset of this data type family.
- **[Sensitive](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/lang_data_sensitive)**  
    Sensitive types in the Puppet language are strings marked as sensitive. The value is displayed in plain text in the catalog and manifest, but is redacted from logs and reports. Because the value is maintained as plain text, use it only as an aid to ensure that sensitive values are not inadvertently disclosed.
- **[Strings](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/lang_data_string#lang_data_string)**  
    Strings are unstructured text fragments of any length. They’re a common and useful data type.
- **[Time-related data types](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/lang_data_time#lang_data_time)**  
    A `Timespan` defines the length of a duration of time, and a `Timestamp` defines a point in time. For example, “two hours” is a duration that can be represented as a `Timespan`, while “three o'clock in the afternoon UTC on 8 November, 2018” is a point in time that can be represented as a `Timestamp`. Both types can use nanosecond values if it is available on the platform.
- **[Undef](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/lang_data_undef)**  
    Puppet's `undef` value is roughly equivalent to `nil` in Ruby. It represents the absence of a value. If the `strict_variables` setting isn’t enabled, variables which have never been declared have a value of `undef`.
