# Core Tools
These subcommands form the core of Puppet's tool set, and every user should understand what they do.

- [puppet agent](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/man/agent)
- [puppet apply](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/man/apply)
- [puppet lookup](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/man/lookup)
- [puppet module](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/man/module)
- [puppet resource](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/man/resource)
    

> Note: The `puppet cert` command is available only in Puppet versions prior to 6.0. For 6.0 and later, use the [`puppetserver cert`command](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6/puppet_server_ca_cli).

# Secondary subcommands

Many or most users need to use these subcommands at some point, but they aren't needed for daily use the way the core tools are.

# Niche subcommands
