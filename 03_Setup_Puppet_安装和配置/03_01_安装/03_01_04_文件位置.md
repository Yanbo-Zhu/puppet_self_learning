File sync access log
    Location: /var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/file-sync-access.log

    This is the log file for PCP brokers on compilers.
    Location: /var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/pcp-broker.log 
General Puppet Server log
    This is where the primary server logs its activity, including compilation errors and deprecation warnings.
    Location: /var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/puppetserver.log

## 2.2 Agent logs

The agent log locations depend on the agent node's operating system.
On *nix nodes, the agent service logs activity to the syslog service. The node's operating system and syslog configuration determines where these messages are saved. The default locations are as follows:

    Linux: /var/log/messages
    macOS: /var/log/system.log
    Solaris: /var/adm/messages

On Windows nodes, the agent service logs its activity to the Event Log. Browse the Event Viewer to view those messages. You might need to enable Logging and debugging.

    Only exists on machines from which a web-based installation was performed.
    Location: /var/log/puppetlabs/installer/http.log 
Orchestrator info log
    Contains run details about puppet infrastructure commands that use the orchestrator. This includes commands to provision and upgrade compilers, convert legacy compilers, and regenerate agent and compiler certificates.

Last installer run logs, by hostname
    Contains the contents of the last installer run.
    There can be multiple log files, labeled by hostname.
    Location: /var/log/puppetlabs/installer/install_log.lastrun.`<HOSTNAME>`.log 
Installer operation logs, by timestamp
    Captures operations performed during installation and any errors that occurred.
    There can be multiple log files, labeled by timestamp.
    /var/log/puppetlabs/installer/installer-`<TIMESTAMP>`.log
Disaster recovery command logs, by action, timestamp, and description
    Contains details about disaster recovery command execution.
    There can be multiple log files for each command because each action triggers multiple Puppet runs (Some on the primary server and some on the replica).
    Location:/var/log/puppetlabs/installer/`<ACTION-NAME>_<TIMESTAMP>_<RUN-DESCRIPTION>`.log 
Bolt info log
    Can be valuable when Troubleshooting disaster recovery.
    Location: /var/log/puppetlabs/installer/bolt_info.log

General PuppetDB log
    Location: /var/log/puppetlabs/puppetdb/puppetdb.log

# 3 Certificates installed 

These certs can be found at `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs`.

![[03_Setup_Puppet_安装和配置/03_01_安装/images/Pasted image 20240321124001.png]]

During installation, the software generates and installs a number of SSL certificates so that agents and services can authenticate themselves.

A certificate with the same name as the agent that runs on the primary server is generated during installation. This certificate is used by PuppetDB and the console.

Services that run on the primary server — for example, `pe-orchestration-services` and `pe-console-services` — use the agent certificate to authenticate.

The certificate authority, if active, stores its certificate information at `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ca`. You can learn more about the certificate authority service on the [PE software architecture](https://www.puppet.com/docs/pe/2023.6/pe_architecture_overview#pe_architecture_overview "Puppet Enterprise (PE) is made up of various components and services including the primary server and compilers, the Puppet agent, console services, Code Manager and r10k, orchestration services, and databases.") page.

**Related information**  

- [SSL and certificates](https://www.puppet.com/docs/pe/2023.6/ssl_and_certificates "Network communications and security in Puppet Enterprise are based on HTTPS, which secures traffic using X.509 certificates. PE includes its own CA tools, which you can use to regenerate certs as needed.")
- [Use an independent intermediate certificate authority](https://www.puppet.com/docs/pe/2023.6/use_an_independent_intermediate_ca "The built-in Puppet certificate authority automatically generates a root and intermediate certificate, but if you need additional intermediate certificates or prefer to use a public authority CA, you can set up an independent intermediate certificate authority. You must complete this configuration during installation.")

# 4 Secret key file installed

During installation, the software generates secret key files that are used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data.

The inventory service secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data stored in the inventory service. This key is stored at:

```
/etc/puppetlabs/orchestration-services/conf.d/secrets/keys.json
```

The console services secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt passwords used for LDAP connections. This key is stored at:

```
/etc/puppetlabs/console-services/conf.d/secrets/keys.json
```
