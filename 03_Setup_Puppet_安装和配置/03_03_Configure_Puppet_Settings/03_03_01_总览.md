# 1 Configure Puppet settings

https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/config_puppet_configuration.html

You can configure Puppet's commands and services extensively, and its settings are specified in a variety of places.

- **[Puppet settings](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/config_about_settings#config_about_settings)**  
    Customize Puppet settings in the main configuration file, called `puppet.conf`.
- **[Key configuration settings](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/config_important_settings#config_important_settings)**  
    Puppet has about 200 settings, all of which are listed in the configuration reference. Most of the time, you interact with only a couple dozen of them. This page lists the most important ones, assuming that you're okay with default values for things like the port Puppet uses for network traffic. See the configuration reference for more details on each.
- **[Puppet's configuration files](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/config_files)**  
    Puppet settings can be configured in the main config file, called `puppet.conf`. There are several additional configuration files, for new settings and ones that need to be in separate files with complex data structures.
- **[Adding file server mount points](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/file_serving)**  
    Puppet Server includes a file server for transferring static file content to agents. If you need to serve large files that you don't want to store in source control or distribute with a module, you can make a custom file server mount point and let Puppet serve those files from another directory.
- **[Checking the values of settings](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/config_print)**  
    Puppet settings are highly dynamic, and their values can come from several different places. To see the actual settings values that a Puppet service uses, run the `puppet config print` command.
- **[Editing settings on the command line](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/config_set)**  
    Puppet loads most of its settings from the `puppet.conf` config file. You can edit this file directly, or you can change individual settings with the `puppet config set` command.
