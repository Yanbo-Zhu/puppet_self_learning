Resources contained in classes and defined types share the relationships of those classes and defined types. Resources are not subject to scope: a resource in any area of code can be referenced from any other area of code.

A resource declaration adds a resource to the catalog and tells Puppet to manage that resource's state.

When Puppet applies the compiled catalog, it:
1. Reads the actual state of the resource on the target system.
2. Compares the actual state to the desired state.
3. If necessary, changes the system to enforce the desired state.
4. Logs any changes made to the resource. These changes appear in Puppet agent's log and in the run report, which is sent to the primary server and forwarded to any specified report processors.

If the catalog doesn't contain a particular resource, Puppet does nothing with whatever that resource described. If you remove a package resource from your manifests, Puppet doesn't uninstall the package; instead, it just ignores it. To remove a package, manage it as a resource and set `ensure => absent`.

You can delay adding resources to the catalog. For example, classes and defined types can contain groups of resources. These resources are managed only if you add that class or defined resource to the catalog. Virtual resources are added to the catalog only after they are realized.
