Every resource (file, user, service, package, and so on) is associated with a resource type within the Puppet language. The resource type defines the kind of configuration it manages. This section provides information about the resource types that are built into Puppet.

- **[Built-in types](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/cheatsheet_core_types#cheatsheet_core_types)**  
    This page provides a reference guide for Puppet's built-in types: `package`, `file`, `service`, `notify`, `exec`, `user`, and `group`.
- **[Optional resource types for Windows](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/resources_windows_optional)**  
    In addition to the resource types included with Puppet, you can install custom resource types as modules from the Forge. This is especially useful when managing Windows systems, because there are several important Windows-specific resource types that are developed as modules rather than as part of core Puppet.
- **[Resource Type: exec](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/types/exec)**  
    
- **[Using exec on Windows](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/resources_exec_windows)**  
    Puppet uses the same `exec` resource type on both *nix and Windows systems, and there are a few Windows-specific best practices and tips to keep in mind.
- **[Resource Type: file](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/types/file)**  
    
- **[Using file on Windows](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/resources_file_windows)**  
    Use Puppet's built-in `file` resource type to manage files and directories on Windows, including ownership, group, permissions, and content, with the following Windows-specific notes and tips.
- **[Resource Type: filebucket](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/8/types/filebucket)**
