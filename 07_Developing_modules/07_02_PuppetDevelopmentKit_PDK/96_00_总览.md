PDK 的主要作用 就是 Developing module


Create a complete module with classes, defined types, and tasks, and test and validate your work as you go.

PDK provides a complete module structure, templates for classes, defined types, and tasks, and a testing infrastructure. You can validate and test your module against various operating systems and multiple Puppet versions.

You can also convert existing modules to make them compatible with PDK. This allows you to use all of the creation, validation, and testing tools in PDK with the converted module.


# 1 PDK development workflow

1. Create a module or convert an existing module to make it compatible with PDK.    
2. Validate your module to verify that it is well-formed.
3. Unit test your module to verify that all dependencies and directories are present.
4. Generate classes, defined types, or tasks in your module.
5. Validate and test your module each time you add new functionality.
